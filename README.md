##  How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaned and processed housing data  
   - Handled outliers and missing values  
   - Performed one-hot encoding on locations  

2. **Model Building**:  
   - Trained a linear regression model  
   - Saved model using `pickle`  

3. **Backend (Flask)**:  
   - Exposes two endpoints:
     - `/get_location_names` (GET)  
     - `/predict_home_price` (POST)  

4. **Frontend Integration**:  
   - User selects location, enters BHK, bath, and size  
   - On form submission, frontend fetches prediction from Flask backend
